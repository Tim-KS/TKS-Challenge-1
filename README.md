I wanted to contribute to developing a more accessible and optimized site for Horiseon. More accessible sites will have priority in search engine results, meaning that more clients will end up on our landing page. This will also mean that our clients will have the option to use accessible features, which will improve turnover and relations with clients.
I also optimised the code to make it easier to read and more concise. A quick rundown:
- Websites with high accesibility have priority in search engine results.
- Our webiste follows the modern standard of accessibilty
- More cliets will be likely to go with us
- Code is more clear and concise now
